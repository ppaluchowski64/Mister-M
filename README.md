# Mister M :video_game:

Mister M is a funny and fast-paced game created during the SCI Hackathon. The theme of the Hackathon was **breaking barriers**, and this game is all about smashing through them... with your head! :smile:

## :brain: Game Idea
You play as Mister M - or more exactly, his head. The head is thrown forward, and you must control it so it keeps bouncing and moving fast.

On the arena you will face barriers:
- **Concrete barriers** - break them to move forward, but you lose speed unless you hit the special **breakpoints**.
- **Laser barriers** - activate your **laser shield** in time, or Mister M will burn! :fire:

## :zap: Special Abilities
- **Dash (E)** - a big speed boost. Great for recovering lost speed, but dangerous near lasers.
- **Laser Shield (R)** - protects you from laser barriers.
- Both dash and shield recharge over time.
- Touching an **Apple logo** on the road makes dash recharge faster :apple:

## :joystick: Controls
- **W** -> Jump (bounce the head)
- **E** -> Dash
- **R** -> Laser Shield

## :book: Tutorial & Humor
The game includes a short tutorial to help new players. It was made with humor and contains many hidden **easter eggs** for you to discover :tada:

## :rocket: Why You Should Try It
We put a lot of stress, effort, and sleepless hours into making Mister M. It cost us sweat, nerves, and energy - but the result is something we are proud of! :muscle: Please **download it, play it, and share your feedback** - every player makes our work worth it :heart:
